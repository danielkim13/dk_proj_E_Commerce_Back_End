<h2 align="center"><b>About the Project</b></h4>

<p>The project is about building a back-end of a customer's e-commerce website. Using Express.js API and Sequelize configuration will interact with a MySQL database. </p>

## Installation

<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN a functional Express.js API</b></p>

    - #1: WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
          THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

    - #2: WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
          THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

    - #3: WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
          THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

    - #4: WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
          THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

    - #5: WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
         THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
